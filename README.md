# Music Store


I developed a project that I thought of as a music store.\
I tried to use all the requirements in the project, so there were places where I used both use context and redux.\
You become authetication in the project.\
You can add or delete new songs.\
You can add it to your favourites.\
You can search through the searchbar.\
In this project I used the following 

### `npm start`
### `React.js`
### `TypeScript`
### `React Hooks`
### `Redux`
### `React Router`
### `React Context`
### `React Tooltip`
### `React Toastify`
### `React Icons`
### `Pure CSS for styling and responsive desing`

Thank you for your time.
